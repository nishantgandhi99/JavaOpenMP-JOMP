# JOMP: Java OpenMP

JOMP was a research project that defined and implemented an OpenMP-like set of directives and library routines for shared memory parallel programming in Java.

It is possible to write shared memory parallel programs using Java's native threads model, but a directive system has a number of advantages. It is considerably easier to use, less error prone and allows compatibility to be maintained with a sequential version.
